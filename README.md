# UiPath Form Submission Automation

## Overview

This UiPath project automates the submission of form data from a spreadsheet into a dynamic web form. The challenge involves handling changing positions of form fields after each submission over 10 rounds. The project is built using UiPath ReFramework and integrates with UiPath Orchestrator Queue for efficient transaction processing.

## Features

- Spreadsheet data extraction and processing.
- Dynamic identification of form fields using reliable selectors.
- Integration with UiPath Orchestrator Queue for transaction management.
- Retry mechanism for handling transient errors during form submission.
- Countdown and submission limit adherence.
- Comprehensive logging and exception handling.

## Project Structure

- **Main.xaml:** Orchestrates the entire automation process using the ReFramework.
- **Process.xaml:** Contains the logic for reading spreadsheet data, dynamic form filling, and submission.
- **Config.xlsx:** Configuration file for application settings.
- **Project Dependencies:** Orchestrator activities, Excel activities, and other relevant packages.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/uipath-form-automation.git
    ```

2. Open the project in UiPath Studio.

3. Update the Config.xlsx file with the necessary settings.

4. Configure Orchestrator connection details in the Config.xlsx file.

5. Run the Main.xaml file to start the automation.

## Configuration

- **Config.xlsx:** Modify this file to update application settings, Orchestrator details, and other configurations.

## Orchestrator Queue Integration

1. Create a new queue in UiPath Orchestrator named `FormSubmissionQueue`.
2. Enqueue the necessary data (spreadsheet rows) into the `FormSubmissionQueue` for processing.

## Customization

- **Dynamic Field Identification:** Customize the selectors and logic in `Process.xaml` to adapt to the changing positions of form fields.

## Testing

Thoroughly test the automation with different scenarios, considering changing form field positions and other edge cases.

## Known Issues

- No known issues at the moment.
